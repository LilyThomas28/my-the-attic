# THE ATTIC

## Description

We have decided to build a MERN stack app that targets developers and more specifically, jr developers that are just starting out. Our concept is to build this app that allows developers a single platform to save important terminal commands and other resourceful code snippets that they reuse often. Imagine you are a young developer that is constantly searching stack overflow and many other sites for a couple of lines of code that you have to refer back to every time you want to use it. Our app will eliminate the need for searching this every time you need it. Our app will allow you to organize whatever code you find useful by programming language, priority, and type of note (whether it be a block of code or a link to helpful documentation of some kind). The main motivations are reusability, organization, and most importantly, saving time. 

Similar native apps are Microsoft sticky notes, and mac stickies. There are also similar apps in the Mac App Store, Microsoft Store, and lots of “sticky-note” repos on GitHub. However, we are set apart from similar platforms because we are not a public forum.
